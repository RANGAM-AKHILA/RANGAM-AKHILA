            "Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.\n",

            "The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!\n",

            "The directing seems too pretentious.\n",
            "And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.\n",

            "IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.\n",
            "Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.\n",

            "This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.\n",

            "I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.\n",
            "It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.5 to see this crap.\n",
            "NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).\n",
            "This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.\n",
            "Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.\n",

TF-IDF gives better accuracy than Bag -of- words because it decreases the weight of common words that appear in many documents.It  highlights different and informative words that are more important in classification.It also consider both term frequency and how words are rare.This also helps model to focus on the most meaningful features.\n",
        "2.Yes, word embedding techniques like Word2Vec,GloVe and FastText are better than BoW and TF-IDF.They helps in recording the semantic meaning and words context in vector space.Moreover,they understand word similarities and relationships.These embeddings better the model performance in nlp.\n",
